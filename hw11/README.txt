I created a multiplayer game called "DON'T TOUCH THE EDGES OF THE WORLD". 
It's a multiplayer game in the sense that two players team up to achieve the best score.

The game works this way:
There are two robots each control by one player.
The objective of the game is to move around the surface of the earth for as along as possible without touching the edges.
Both players(the A team) have 6 lives. Each time one of them touches the edge of the earth with their robot, they lose a life.
However, each time any of the players touches the edge, the speed of the robot increases by 0.2. Hence, making it more difficult to control.
Your chances of lose a life increases more and more when you hit the edges.
At the start of the game, the clock starts. Your score at the end of the game is how long you lasted(in seconds) before losing all 6 lives as a team.
